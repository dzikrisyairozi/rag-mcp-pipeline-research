# RAG-MCP Pipeline Research

A comprehensive research project exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multi-Cloud Processing (MCP) server integration.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a structured learning and research path for understanding how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with external services through MCP servers, with a focus on practical business applications such as accounting software integration (e.g., QuickBooks).

## Research Modules

### Module 0: [Prerequisites](./docs/modules/module_0/README.md)
Establish a solid foundation before diving into specific areas:
- Programming & Tools: Python, Git/GitHub, Docker
- Basic Concepts: Machine learning, RESTful APIs, cloud services
- AI & LLM Foundations: Understanding transformers, RAG, and prompt engineering
- Development environment setup

### Module 1: AI Modeling & LLM Integration
- Understanding different LLM architectures and capabilities
- Integration methods with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models)
- Fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific tasks
- Evaluation metrics and performance optimization

### Module 2: Hosting & Deployment Strategies for AI
- Scalable infrastructure for AI applications
- Cost optimization techniques
- Model serving options (serverless, container-based, dedicated instances)
- Monitoring and observability for LLM applications

### Module 3: Deep Dive into MCP Servers
- Architecture and components of MCP servers
- Building secure API gateways for external service integration
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Command execution protocols and standardization

### Module 4: API Integration & Command Execution
- Integration with business software APIs (QuickBooks, etc.)
- Data transformation and normalization
- Error handling and resilience strategies
- Testing and validation methodologies

### Module 5: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) & Alternative Strategies
- Vector database selection and optimization
- Document processing pipelines
- Hybrid retrieval approaches
- Alternative augmentation strategies for LLMs
