# RAG-MCP Pipeline Research

A comprehensive research project exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multi-Cloud Processing (MCP) server integration using **free and open-source models**.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a structured learning and research path for understanding how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with external services through MCP servers, with a focus on practical business applications such as accounting software integration (e.g., QuickBooks).

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **No paid API keys required** - uses free Hugging Face models
- **Run everything locally** without external dependencies
- **Comprehensive step-by-step documentation** for beginners
- **Practical examples** with working code

## Research Modules

### Module 0: [Prerequisites](./docs/modules/module_0/README.md)
Establish a solid foundation before diving into specific areas:
- Programming & Tools: Python, Git/GitHub, Docker
- Basic Concepts: Machine learning, RESTful APIs, cloud services
- AI & LLM Foundations: Understanding transformers, RAG, and prompt engineering
- Development environment setup with free models

### Module 1: AI Modeling & LLM Integration
- Understanding different LLM architectures and capabilities
- Integration methods with various LLM providers (Hugging Face, open-source models)
- Fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific tasks
- Evaluation metrics and performance optimization

### Module 2: Hosting & Deployment Strategies for AI
- Scalable infrastructure for AI applications
- Cost optimization techniques
- Model serving options (serverless, container-based, dedicated instances)
- Monitoring and observability for LLM applications

### Module 3: Deep Dive into MCP Servers
- Architecture and components of MCP servers
- Building secure API gateways for external service integration
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Command execution protocols and standardization

### Module 4: API Integration & Command Execution
- Integration with business software APIs (QuickBooks, etc.)
- Data transformation and normalization
- Error handling and resilience strategies
- Testing and validation methodologies

### Module 5: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) & Alternative Strategies
- Vector database selection and optimization
- Document processing pipelines
- Hybrid retrieval approaches
- Alternative augmentation strategies for LLMs

## Project Goals

1. Gain comprehensive understanding of RAG and MCP server concepts
2. Build prototype integrations with popular business software
3. Develop a framework for AI-powered data entry and processing
4. Create documentation and best practices for future implementations

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-mcp-pipeline-research.git
   cd rag-mcp-pipeline-research
   ```

2. Run the setup script to prepare your environment
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   python src/setup_environment.py
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Start with [Module 0: Prerequisites](./docs/modules/module_0/README.md)
5. Progress through each module sequentially
6. Complete the practical exercises in each section

## Why Free Models?

This project intentionally uses free, open-source models from Hugging Face instead of commercial APIs like OpenAI for several reasons:

1. **Accessibility** - Anyone can follow along without financial barriers
2. **Educational Value** - Better understanding of how models work internally
3. **Privacy** - All processing happens locally on your machine
4. **Flexibility** - Easier to customize and fine-tune models for specific needs
5. **Future-Proofing** - Skills transfer to any model, not tied to specific providers

For production applications, you may choose to use commercial APIs for better performance, but the concepts learned here apply universally.
